Overwhelmed by greed, you rush to grab as much as you can. But as your hands touch the gold, 
the room begins to shift and tremble violently. The walls close in, and the air grows cold.
A booming voice echoes around you, its tone both mocking and sorrowful:
"The price of greed is the loss of freedom. You have failed the test of the mansion."
The treasure melts into shadow, and the room transforms into an endless maze of darkness.
You frantically try to retrace your steps, but the mansion has sealed itself. 
Trapped in its depths, you become another forgotten soul, your name whispered 
in the haunting tales of Eldridge Hollow.
