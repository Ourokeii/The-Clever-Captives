In the quiet town of Eldridge Hollow, whispers of an abandoned house on the 
outskirts have stirred the curiosity of many. The locals tell tales of a crumbling 
mansion, long forgotten by time, rumored to hold untold treasures hidden 
within its dusty walls. Legends say that a wealthy merchant once resided 
there, his fortune amassed from rare artifacts and gold coins. However, it’s not 
just the allure of riches that keeps townsfolk at bay.
            
The house is shrouded in mystery, and those who dare approach speak of 
intricate riddles and treacherous puzzles that guard the wealth inside. Many 
have attempted to unravel its secrets, but the house has claimed their 
courage, leaving them disoriented and defeated. Now, it sits silently, 
beckoning for someone brave enough to enter its shadowy corridors.
            
You’ve heard these stories, and the thrill of adventure ignites a fire within you. 
Armed with a keen mind and an insatiable curiosity, you decide to uncover the 
truth behind the mansion's treasures. With each step toward the threshold, the 
weight of the unknown settles upon you. Can you solve the riddles and escape 
with the fortune, or will you become just another name in the town’s haunting 
tales?
