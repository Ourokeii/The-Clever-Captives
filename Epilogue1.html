After solving the mansion’s final, most intricate puzzle, a hidden door 
creaks open, revealing a dazzling chamber filled with gold coins, glittering jewels, 
and ancient artifacts. Among the treasures, you find a weathered journal 
resting atop a chest. The journal, written by the mansion’s original owner, 
details his life’s work: a collection of puzzles and riddles meant to guard not 
just his wealth but also his greatest treasures.

As you marvel at your discovery, the journal reveals one last cryptic message:
"To claim your reward, you must leave with only what you can carry. Choose 
wisely, adventurer, for greed leads to ruin, and humility reveals the greatest 
treasure of all."
                        
The room begins to rumble, urging you to make a decision. Do you risk taking it 
all, or honor the merchant’s final lesson?
